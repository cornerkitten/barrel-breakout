Hello Everyone!

For those of you curious to see the current state of a simple-just-for-fun game I have been working on over the past week, feel free to keep on reading.

# About the Game #
The name of the game is Barrel Breakout - featuring the beloved gorilla, Donkey Kong.  The game is a take on breakout, using sprites from Donkey Kong Country (released on Super Nintendo).  The goal of the game is to break all the barrels.

# Setup #
In order to run Barrel Blast, your computer must have the Microsoft XNA Framework (version 4.0) installed.  If you do not have this framework, please visit https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=20914 . Once installed, the framework occupies about 10 MB of hard drive space.

If you are unsure whether this framework is installed, go to Programs and Features in Window's Control Panel.  If there is a program name listed as "Microsoft XNA Framework Redistributable 4.0", you should be good to go.

Once you have the XNA Framework installed, follow these steps:
* Click/run BarrelBreakout.exe
* Have fun!

# Controls #
You control a moving platform at the bottom of the game screen.  Move the platform left and right in order to prevent Donkey Kong from falling down into an untimely demise.
* Left / A:  Move platform to the left
* Right / D:  Move platform to the right
* Q : Quit game

# Disclaimer:  Prototype Approaching #
The game is still in a prototype phase.  In this case, prototype means
* There is no scoring
* The player cannot lose
* Some collisions may cause DK (Donkey Kong) to respond unexpectedly
* Donkey Kong bounces off the platform in a boring pattern
* There is no sound/music
* There is only one "level"

In other words, the game is not finished.  That said, any questions or feedback are still certainly welcome.

# Purpose #
The purpose of this project has been to provide me experience in learning the XNA framework (which is used in my game development class), as well as brush up on some game engine design problems (such as collision detection and reaction).

Breakout was picked partly because of its simplicity.  However, another influential reason is that my very first coding experience involved hacking the JavaScript programming of a breakout game in the year 2000.  Good times.
